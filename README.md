## Robert Phillips

Recent graduate from the Makers Data Engineering track with 4 years previous experience in a data role. Skilled in Python, SQL, Cloud computing (AWS), ETL pipelines (Airflow, Kafka) and data infrastructure (dbt, postgreSQL).

Tech excites me as it offers the perfect blend of creativity and logic. It provides the ultimate challenge of using my interpersonal skills to understand the needs of a client, before then using my problem-solving skills to translate those needs into a technical product. It's a full brain workout which I find highly stimulating and rewarding!

## Work Experience

**HMRC** (MAR 2019 to APR 2023)  
_Compliance Officer_

- **Data Analysis**: analysis of customs data, extracted from government systems using SQL, to piece together large and complex alcohol supply chains and identify risks to excise duty.
- **Data Validation**: validation of customs data to ensure reliability and integrity, through the removal of duplicates, null values and corrupted data.
- **Data-driven Insights**: presentation of data to external stakeholders using tools such as PowerBI and Excel to highlight risks in the supply chain. 
- **Measurable Results**: influenced producers through data-led interventions to alter their supply chains and thereby prevent alcohol from entering high-risk markets. As a result of one of my interventions, £3.2m of revenue was protected.
- **Data Protection**: maintained strict adherence to GDPR through the careful handling, storage and sharing of data.

**DeVere Group** (AUG 2017 to MAR 2018)  
_Account Manager_

- **Client Services:** liaised with new and existing clients, analysed portfolios and assisted with Russian translation in a financial consultancy.

**Lincoln School** (SEPT 2016 to JULY 2017)  
_English Teacher_

## Education

**Makers Academy** (APR 2023 to AUG 2023) \
_Data Engineering Course_

- **Modern Engineering Practices:** the course simulated a real-life software job as much as possible, frequently exposing me to common practices, such as TDD, source control, modular design, debugging, daily stand-ups and pair programming.
- **Data Analysis:** utilised Python libraries for data science, such as pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. Predictive statistics, such as linear regression. Use of ‘sklearn’, a machine learning module, to test statistical models.
- **Data-rich Presentation:** extracted data from related databases and generated insights for a mock client. Created dashboards and Jupyter notebooks to present data in a clear and informative way.
- **Batch Processing:** configured Apache Airflow to automate pipelines to run at set intervals. Wrote ETL jobs inside an EC2 instance to move and manipulate data held in AWS Cloud storage (RDS and S3).
- **Data Warehouses:** transformed raw data stored in the Cloud into usable data models and tested its quality using DBT. 
- **Stream Processing:** near real-time insights delivered using Kafka and PySpark.
- **Distributed Applications:** utilised AWS services, such as Lambda and Athena to interact with databases deployed to the Cloud. Configured GitHub workflows to implement CI-CD practices.

**Nology** (OCT 2021 to OCT 2022) \
_Web Developer Course_

- **Frontend:** honed my frontend skills through the completion of several projects, with a focus on responsiveness, OOP, TDD and clean code principles.
- **Backend:** acquired fundamental skills in server-side development, exploring key concepts such as databases, authentication, data persistence, and RESTful APIs.
- **Source control:** extensive use of Git to collaborate, share and protect code.

**University of Bristol (2010 to 2014)** \
_BA (Hons) Russian and Politics_

- 2.1
- Survived a Siberian winter.

#### Any other qualifications

**TEFL** - spent 1 year teaching English abroard in South Korea.

## Hobbies

I run and play at a local badminton club which competes in the Bristol League.

Passionate board gamer - current favourite is "Brass: Birmingham" a strategy game set during the industrial revolution of the Midlands.
