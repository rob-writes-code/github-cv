## Work Experience

**HMRC** (MAR 2019 to APR 2023)  
_Compliance Officer_

- **Data Analysis**: analysis of customs data, extracted from government systems using SQL, to piece together large and complex alcohol supply chains and identify risks to excise duty.
- **Data Validation**: validation of customs data to ensure reliability and integrity, through the removal of duplicates, null values and corrupted data.
- **Data-driven Insights**: presentation of data to external stakeholders using tools such as PowerBI and Excel to highlight risks in the supply chain. 
- **Measurable Results**: influenced producers through data-led interventions to alter their supply chains and thereby prevent alcohol from entering high-risk markets. As a result of one of my interventions, £3.2m of revenue was protected.
- **Data Protection**: maintained strict adherence to GDPR through the careful handling, storage and sharing of data.

**DeVere Group** (AUG 2017 to MAR 2018)  
_Account Manager_

- **Client Services:** liaised with new and existing clients, analysed portfolios and assisted with Russian translation in a financial consultancy.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (APR 2023 to AUG 2023)
- **Modern Engineering Practices:** the course simulated a real-life software job as much as possible, frequently exposing me to common practices, such as TDD, source control, modular design, debugging, daily stand-ups and pair programming.
- **Data Analysis:** utilised Python libraries for data science, such as pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. Predictive statistics, such as linear regression. Use of ‘sklearn’, a machine learning module, to test statistical models.
- **Data-rich Presentation:** extracted data from related databases and generated insights for a mock client. Created dashboards and Jupyter notebooks to present data in a clear and informative way.
- **Batch Processing:** configured Apache Airflow to automate pipelines to run at set intervals. Wrote ETL jobs inside an EC2 instance to move and manipulate data held in AWS Cloud storage (RDS and S3).
- **Data Warehouses:** transformed raw data stored in the Cloud into usable data models and tested its quality using DBT. 
- **Stream Processing:** near real-time insights delivered using Kafka and PySpark.
- **Distributed Applications:** utilised AWS services, such as Lambda and Athena to interact with databases deployed to the Cloud. Configured GitHub workflows to implement CI-CD practices.

#### University of Bristol (2010 to 2014)

- BA (Hons) Russian and Politics
- 2.1
- Survived a Siberian winter.

#### Any other qualifications

**TEFL** - spent 1 year teaching English abroard in South Korea.

## Hobbies

I run and play at a local badminton club which competes in the Bristol League.

Passionate board gamer - current favourite is "Brass: Birmingham" a strategy game set during the industrial revolution of the Midlands.
