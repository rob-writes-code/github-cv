# Will Bentinck

A beardy, bear-like thing with a sometimes overly enthusiastic passion for recruitment and education reform, especially in the tech world. I've founded and helped grow a number of social and commercial enterprises in both education and recruitment: some of which bombed, others soared. This year, I'd like to anchor my specialism and find an organisation that I can add exceptional value to, long-term.

## Skills

### Public Speaking

Comfortable and confident in front of large groups of people, even when mightily unprepared, I'm an effective and entertaining speaker, using humour, metaphor and occasionally audience participation to make clear and memorable points.
