# Will Bentinck

A beardy, bear-like thing with a sometimes overly enthusiastic passion for recruitment and education reform, especially in the tech world. I've founded and helped grow a number of social and commercial enterprises in both education and recruitment: some of which bombed, others soared. This year, I'd like to anchor my specialism and find an organisation that I can add exceptional value to, long-term.
