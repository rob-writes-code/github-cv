# Will Bentinck

A beardy, bear-like thing with a sometimes overly enthusiastic passion for recruitment and education reform, especially in the tech world. I've founded and helped grow a number of social and commercial enterprises in both education and recruitment: some of which bombed, others soared. This year, I'd like to anchor my specialism and find an organisation that I can add exceptional value to, long-term.

## Skills

#### Public Speaking

Comfortable and confident in front of large groups of people, even when mightily unprepared, I'm an effective and entertaining speaker, using humour, metaphor and occasionally audience participation to make clear and memorable points.

- [TEDxSquareMile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6eOT0nxQJ0): *Embrace Your Inner Spiderman*
- Main stage of [Digital Shoreditch 2015](https://youtu.be/HrvmTTbWi9w): *Don't learn to code*
- [Live TV interview](http://www.londonlive.co.uk/news/helping-kick-start-an-educational-revolution) on LondonLive, with a very silly moustache

#### Ruby

I think this is pretty impressive:

- I did the Hartl tutorial, but couldn't do any of the exercises.
- Embarrassingly, it's actually [still on Heroku](http://fierce-bastion-1684.heroku.com/).
- I can't do better than a 7kyu on Codewars right now.

#### Recruitment

- Arranged the hiring of 200+ graduates into jobs in more than 50 of Europe's best young tech companies, running the partnership between **Wayra Europe** and **Enternships** over its 18 month existence.
- Coached and mentored startups on their recruitment practices, especially finding and attracting technical talent: mentor at **Wayra UK**; course leader at **The Accelerator Academy**; and regular recruitment advisor at **IDEALondon**.
- Co-founded **Levantine Links**, a social enterprise recruiting UK graduates to teach English in Syria, to local children and adults displaced from Iraq. Recruited 4 TEFL-experienced graduates and an ex-headmaster and planned an integration with local school curriculum, spending only Â£30. Civil war unfortunately got in the way.

## Education

#### Heythrop College, University of London - 2007 to 2010

- Philosophy, especially the philosophy of maths and language.
- First Class Honours
- Founded the drama society: HeADS
